The retained JSON records shared API idempotency, a real SIGKILL/exit 137,
successful attempt-two recovery after natural lease expiry, golden report equality
and test-gate removal/baseline restoration. Only one attempt completed.

This is local Compose process continuity with a single PostgreSQL database.
It does not establish database, Kubernetes, AZ or cloud queue HA. The Kubernetes
profile was schema-checked only; no cloud resources were created.
